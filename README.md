# odin-recipies

This is a project being done for the Odin Project class. I am already aware of how to script with HTML and CSS but I am taking the class to learn a little more about JavaScript. 

These projects might look rudementary and that is because they are. It is only uploaded so I can practice using Git in the terminal instead of uploading it into the GitHub GUI. (extremely bad habit)

For a more indepth look at my front end capabilities, you would have to look lower at some previous projects. 

Thank you and Enjoy!
