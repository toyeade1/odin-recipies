    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>Nigerian Shawarma is the ‚ÄùNigerian version' of the famous Shawarma
             (made with beef or chicken filling). This tasty snack has become a
              popular meal on the streets of Nigeria and is also one of the most 
              requested recipes I have received.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 kilogram chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsweetened yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>4 hot dogs</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium-sized bowl, mix garlic powder, cumin, salt, paprika,
                     cayenne, unsweetened yogurt, vegetable oil and two bouillon cubes. 
                     Place the chicken breasts in the mixture, coat completely, and place 
                     in the fridge to marinate for 1 hour.</li>

                 <br>

                <li>In a small bowl, mix all of the liquid ingredients
                     for the filling except for the cabbage and carrot.
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>Slice the cabbage thinly and grate the carrot.
                     Combine and mix the cabbage and carrot in a bowl.
                </li>

                    <br>

                <li>
                   After the chicken breasts have marinated for 1 hour, 
                   take the bowl out of the fridge and place the breasts on the grill. 
                   (You can cut the chicken thinly and put it on a skewer or simply place 
                   it directly on the grill. You can also use an oiled non-stick pan to grill.)</li>

                     <br>

                <li>Heat up the hot dogs on a grill or in a pan. Once the chicken is grilled and cooled somewhat, shred the meat. 
                    Separate pocket pita bread into two thin sheets.
                    Spread sauce generously on the inner side of one bread sheet.</li>

                     <br>

                <li>Add veggies and 1 hot dog. Add shredded chicken. Wrap it up with both bread sheets. 
                    Repeat until all ingredients have been used up. 
                    Grill the shawarmas starting with folded side. The heat of the pan or grill will seal the wrap </li>
            </ol>
