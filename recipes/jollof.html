    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor of rice and chicken.
         Chicken is first sauteed on the stove top to produce a wonderful aromatic base for the rice. 
         For an extra special and authentic touch, serve jollof rice with fried plantains</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Ginger</li>
                <li>Curry</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Black Pepper</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.
                     Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 
                     1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. 
                     Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. 
                     Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes.
                      Remove from heat.</li>
                      <br>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. 
                    Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, 
                    about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 
                    degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
                    <br>
                <li>
                    Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft
                     and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly 
                     thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes. </li>
                     <br>
                <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, 
                    and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is
                     almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is 
                     tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
                     <br>
                <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat.
                     Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3
                      minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains 
                      and serve with chicken. </li>
            </ol>
